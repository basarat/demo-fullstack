# Basics
Uses `grunt-ts`. 
just run `grunt` from `src` directory. 

src is compiled to `fullstack` folder. 
Front end (angular) and back end (express/nodejs) share source code by compiling each file on its own target. (use AMD for frontend and commonjs for backend) 

# Important Files
Gruntfile.js
The source code in the `common` directory is shared
